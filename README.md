# ravelry

Side project focusing on my personal special interest. Crochet.

Using Ravelry API to create a database of yarns with new information on the yarn. This includes weight/length and best price scraped from ecommerce websites.

Goal is to host this searchable database online for other yarn enthusiasts.


I'm learning how to use python along the way. Utilising other languages, frameworks and libraries that make the most sense for my goal.
